 # Israeli Street Names Importer
This project fetches street names for cities in Israel and inserts them into a database using a queueing platform.

The goal of this assignment is to:
- Fetch street name data from an external API.
- Use a queueing platform (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle the data flow.
- Insert the street data into a database using a consumer.

Tech Stack
- **Node.js** `16.x`
- **npm** `8.x`
- **TypeScript** `4.x`
- **Queueing Platform**: RabbitMQ
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
  
Project Structure
- `StreetsService.ts`: Service for fetching street names via API.
- `cities.ts`: Contains a list of Israeli cities to process.
- `producer.ts`: Reads cities, fetches street data, and pushes to the queue.
- `consumer.ts`: Listens to the queue and inserts street data into the database.




Feel free to modify the `StreetsService` class as needed to fit the flow.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install


To complete the assignment you will need to select a database, sql or no-sql (for example: mongo, singlestore) and a queueing service (for example - rabbitmq, kafka), either from the provided dependencies, or one of your choice (commit it to your solution if you chose a different one).\
You will need to create two services:
 - Publishing service - A service that will get the data from the StreetsService and publish it to the queuing platform
 - A service that will consume the data from the queuing service and persisit it to the database

 Publishing service specification:
  - Will be activated by CLI, accepting a city name from the list of cities
  - Will query the StreetsService for all streets of that city
  - Will publish to the queuing platform the streets it needs to insert

Consuming service specification:
  - Will consume from the messaging queue
  - Will persist the streets data to the selected database

The persisted streets need to contain all data from the api

## Provided dependencies:
 Provided is a docker-compose file which contains all of the dependencies that you will need to complete the assignment.\
 **You do not need to lift all of the services**, you can choose which you need as listed in the assignment specification.
 ### The docker-compose exposes the following services:
  - mongoDB
  	- No-sql database, Version - 4.2
	- exposed on localhost port  27017
	- Can be connected to with robo3t/ studio 3t with no need for authentication - https://robomongo.org/
  - Singlestore (formerly memsql)
  	- ANSI SQL compliant and MySQL wire protocol compatible SQL database
	- exposed on port 3306
	- UI studio is exposed on port 8012
		- Authentication:
			- Username: root
			- Password: Password1
 - RabbitMQ
	- backend exposed on port 5672
	- management UI exposed on port 15672
		- Authentication:
			- Username: guest
			- Password: guest
 - Redpanda
	- Fully Kafka-api compatible data streaming platform
	- Kafka broker exposed on port 9092
	- UI exposed on port 8014 with no need for authentication

If you would like to a different service for a database/queueing system feel free to do so, as long as they adhere to the assignement specifications
